## Centro Subacqueo Mediterraneo "Duilio Marcante"

This starter is based on [Andy Bell's CSS workflow/boilerplate](/about/).
In Andy's words, we'd rather hint the browser than micromanage it, using progressive enhancement, CSS layout, fluid type & spacing, and modern CSS features.
The aim is to create frontends that look good to everyone, regardless of device, connection speed or context.

I have tried to [document a few things](/get-started/).

**Have fun** and let me know if you find any issues or have ideas for improvements!
